## Notes

To Make keys repeat when held down in Rstudio vim mode, run:
    defaults write -app RStudio ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

For tmux copy/paste, see
[this](http://www.economyofeffort.com/2013/07/29/reattach-to-user-namespace-the-fix-for-your-tmux-in-os-x-woes/).

Since I map F3/4 to copy/paste in vim, it's good to change those keys to not
require the fn modifier. See [here](http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/).
